# Tennis Stringing Scraper
## What This Project Hopes to Accomplish
Since I string tennis racquets quite often as a part time job, I often check online various racquet-specific information such as the string pattern, holes to skip, and string length required. I hope to create a small app/script using python which scrapes this data off of the web, and allows me to quickly access this information for each racquet I am handed in real-time.
## Notes:
This is the first time I have written a webscraper so I am expecting it to be a challenge. I am not sure how I want to implement the searching procedure at the moment...whether it be a command line script or some sort of gui application.
